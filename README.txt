Sleep App
Application Manual

Sleep App is an application that helps the user to actively live by the rules of a specific sleep style. The user decides the sleep style they want, and after that they will receive a visual schema with their sleep periods but alarms will also be generated for every wake-up time for the chosen schema. The user can also read about sleep in general and about different sleep styles.

Furthermore there is information available on specific sleeping patterns, that has been tested in the past. When selecting a pattern the application makes a recommendation based on a series of survey questions. Future functionality includes a dedicated conflict management module and a calendar synchronization.
