    <string name="uberman_info_text">Uberman sleepers nap for approximately 20 minutes six times a day (every four hours). This method was successfully adopted by bloggers Steve Pavlina and PureDoxyk – the latter coined the terms “Uberman” and “Everyman” for two of the popular sleeping schedules. Some Uberman sleepers nap for 25 or even 30 minutes instead of the regular 20.</string>
    <string name="monophasic_info_text">Normal sleep with one sleep period per day.</string>
    <string name="biphasic_info_text">It has recently been theorised that, before the advent of electric lighting in Europe, sleepers awoke from their &quot;first&quot; sleep for an hour or more during the night, before returning to their &quot;second&quot; sleep. </string>
    <string name="dymaxion_info_text">This sleeping schedule takes its name from Buckminster Fuller’s invention brand name (a portmanteau of “dynamic maximum tension”). Fuller came up with his polyphasic sleeping system after observing the sleep habits of animals. His original aim was to sleep as soon as felt tired, whenever he felt tired: this turned out to be approximately every six hours, resulting in an equitetraphasic sleep schedule. Those who attempt dymaxion sleep today tend to follow the “30-minute naps four times a day” rule quite rigidly, which is not altogether in the spirit of Fuller. The dymaxion schedule involves fewer naps than all other polyphasic schedules, but the same amount of total sleep time as the Uberman schedule if the latter uses 20-minute naps.</string>
    <string name="everyman_info_text">This schedule is often considered to be less “extreme” than other forms of polyphasic sleep, as it contains a “core sleep” of a few hours, usually in the early morning, as well as short naps during the day. In reality this system may be more physically difficult to adjust to, as the core sleep will delay the sleep deprivation which triggers the brain to adapt to instantaneous REM sleep upon falling asleep. However, the system may be easier to adjust to psychologically than other sleep schedules, as the core sleep provides a sense of delineation between one day and the next.</string>
